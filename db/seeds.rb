kanto = Generation.find_or_create_by(region: 'Kanto', description: "The Kanto region (Japanese: カントー地方 Kanto region) is a region of the Pokémon world. Kanto is located east of Johto, which together form a joint landmass that is south of Sinnoh.
Kanto is the setting of the first generation of games and can be explored in generations II, III, IV, and VII.
Professor Oak is the resident Pokémon Professor and gives Pokémon Trainers a choice between Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle as their starter Pokémon. In Pokémon Yellow, the only choice is a Pikachu that he recently caught, although he did have an Eevee. In Let's Go, Pikachu!, the player chooses Pikachu. In Let's Go, Eevee!, the player chooses Eevee. In the games, the player begins their journey in Pallet Town and ends it at Indigo Plateau.
The artwork from the early games depict Kanto as grassland. Starting in Generation III, it is shown with denser tree coverage.
All cities in Kanto are named after colors, with the exception of Pallet Town, which refers to a palette, meaning a range of colors. Unlike every other region, Kanto's fictional name reflects its real-world name.", history: "The Kanto region has a rich history of creating Pokémon with technology. Researchers of Kanto have been great at their job. A researcher once cloned Mew through its genes and created the Genetic Pokémon Mewtwo. Porygon, the Virtual Pokémon, was also created by humans in Kanto. In contemporary history, Red/Leaf is given a Pokémon by Professor Oak for personal safety. Professor Oak also gives his grandson, Blue, a Pokémon and asks Blue and Red/Leaf to help him fill the Pokédex, a complete encyclopedia on Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Red/Leaf begins. Red/Leaf travels across the Kanto region and collects all eight Gym Badges. During their journey, Red/Leaf comes across Team Rocket, an evil organization behind wrongdoings about Pokémon. Red/Leaf stops Team Rocket and defeats Giovanni, their boss as well as the Gym Leader of Viridian Gym, who then disbands Team Rocket. In the meantime, Blue, who has also collected all of the Kanto Gym Badges, defeats the Elite Four at the Indigo League and becomes the champion of the Kanto region. Finally, Red/Leaf makes it up to him and defeats him to gain the title of the Indigo League Champion. 
Three years later, Ethan/Kris/Lyra, a Trainer from Johto, comes to Kanto and collects all eight Kanto Gym Badges. Ethan/Kris/Lyra is the current Indigo League Champion and has also met and defeated Red.", geography: "The Kanto region has a very temperate climate and not many notable landscape features, though this may be due to the region's origins in the Generation I games.
The majority of the Kanto region are forests and plains. Many of the major Kanto cities are in the center of the region, with close access to virtually every environment such as the sea, mountains, forests, etc. Kanto is mostly dominated by land, but has a large bay in the middle which opens to a sea in the southwest. Kanto has a contrast between urban cities and rural towns. Kanto has several mountain ranges, which are mostly in northern and western Kanto. Indigo Plateau and Victory Road mountain range divides Kanto from the neighboring Johto region.")
johto = Generation.find_or_create_by(region: 'Johto', description: "The Johto region (Japanese: ジョウト地方 Johto region) is a region of the Pokémon world. Johto is located west of Kanto, which together form a joint landmass that is south of Sinnoh and Sinjoh Ruins.
It was the second core series region to be introduced. First explored in Pokémon Gold and Silver, it is home to an additional 100 Pokémon that were not present in the previous games. It is also the setting of Pokémon Crystal, Pokémon HeartGold, and Pokémon SoulSilver.
Players begin their journey in New Bark Town, where Professor Elm offers either Chikorita, Cyndaquil, or Totodile to beginning Pokémon Trainers.
The English-version names of most of the cities in Johto are names of plants or things related to plants.", history: "1,500 years before modern times, the place now known as the Ruins of Alph was built in Johto, and the earliest known system for writing—the modern Latin alphabet—was developed. Although no one knows exactly who built the Ruins of Alph, research indicates that the people in question were an ancient civilization that wished to co-exist with the enigmatic Unown that bear great similarity to the alphabet letters. Not only did that tribe impart messages on the ruins' walls describing the Unown, but they also erected a Pokémon statue for an unknown reason.
At some point later, outsiders began to gather near the ruins. As the Unown were timid creatures, they rejected contact with anyone but the clan that protected them. To ensure the Unown's well being, the Ruins of Alph's inhabitants decided to leave the region, but not without devising complicated puzzles so that one day the Unown could be summoned again. As for the clan, their quest led them to a mountain far to the north, where they met another group of people who had hailed from the Spear Pillar. Together, the two groups built a temple in honor of Arceus, which incorporated elements from both the Ruins of Alph and the Spear Pillar; this collaboration probably has to do with the underlying relationship between Arceus and the Unown. The temple, too, has since been left in ruins and its lowest floor is now known as the Sinjoh Ruins; however, the ritual of honoring Legendary Pokémon through dance circulated back to Johto, specifically to Ecruteak City.
Approximately 700 years before modern times, the people of Ecruteak built two nine-tier towers with the hopes of fostering friendship and hope between Pokémon and humans. They were the Brass Tower in the west, which was said to awaken Pokémon, and the Bell Tower in the east, where Pokémon were said to rest. Both towers became the roost of powerful flying Pokémon: Lugia and Ho-Oh, respectively. It is unknown what made the residents revere Lugia and Ho-Oh, but a separate tale indicates that Lugia had previously had an encounter with the people of Johto when it stopped a war on the Whirl Islands, which were a single island at that time. The towers stood strong for about 550 years, when a lightning bolt struck the Brass Tower. It was engulfed in flames that raged for three days. A sudden downpour finally put out the blaze, but it had already burnt to the ground. Three nameless Pokémon perished in the fire, but Ho-Oh descended from the sky and resurrected them. The revived Pokémon were made to embody three powers: the lightning that struck the tower, the fire that burned the tower, and the rain that put out the fire. When the Pokémon appeared, they struck terror in those who saw their rise. The three Pokémon, knowing their own power, fled, running like the wind off into Johto's grassland. Similarly, both Lugia and Ho-Oh flew away at the sight of the growing distance between people and Pokémon; while they never returned to Ecruteak, they yearned for a person to touch the hearts and souls of Pokémon once more.In contemporary history, Ethan/Kris/Lyra leaves New Bark Town on an errand for Professor Elm. A red-haired boy steals one of Elm's three Pokémon, and challenges him/her as Ethan/Kris/Lyra's journey across Johto continues. A revived Team Rocket from Kanto, using plans formulated three years prior, enrages many Gyarados, including a red one, at the Lake of Rage; they then proceed to take over the Goldenrod Radio Tower in a desperate attempt to contact Giovanni. When they are defeated and Giovanni fails to return due to Celebi's intervention, the interim leader, Archer, vows to never again re-form Team Rocket. Ethan/Kris/Lyra continues to gather Johto's Badges, eventually gaining all eight and traveling to the Pokémon League at Indigo Plateau in Kanto, later to defeat the current Champion and get into the Hall of Fame.
But Ethan/Kris/Lyra's most notable effect on Johto lies in their ability to encounter all three of the Legendary beasts, as well as summon the Unown, Lugia and Ho-Oh after their long absence. A new chapter in the region's history begins.
Around these times other, smaller events occurred. 500 years before modern days, the Cianwood City Pharmacy, the world's oldest pharmacy, was built. Around 400 years ago, Azalea Town in Johto was struck by a long-term drought wave; after bringing the rain back once again by yawning, Slowpoke gained an honorable position in that town.
", geography: "The Johto region, like its neighboring region, Kanto, has a temperate climate. However, Johto's climate is a bit wetter than that of Kanto's.
Johto is notably more rural than the Kanto region, which leans more towards to the urban side. The region has an abundance of water to the west and south, with Cianwood City most likely being on a separate landmass. However, Johto is still dominated by land. The western parts of the region are mainly low-lying and forested and contain most of the region's population. Johto's ultra-modern Goldenrod City is found in the heart of the region, on the coast. It is the technological, industrial, and economic area of the Johto region. Due to its centralized position in the region, many smaller but important cities and towns connect to the city. There is one large mountain range encompassing almost the entire eastern half of the region, which separates Kanto and Johto and contains Mt. Silver. Blackthorn City is nestled deep between the mountains and is very unique because it is a city for Dragon Tamers.")
hoenn = Generation.find_or_create_by(region: 'Hoenn', description: 'The Hoenn region (Japanese: ホウエン地方 Hoenn region) is a region of the Pokémon world. It is located south of Sinnoh, as stated in The Unbeatable Lightness of Seeing!. It is the setting of Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire. It was the third core series region to be introduced.
Hoenn is inspired by the real-world Japanese main island of Kyushu. The names of most of the cities in Hoenn are made of two words put together (Little Root, Fort Tree, Slate Port, Ever Grande, etc.) rather than colors or plants as Kanto and Johto had done. Professor Birch of Littleroot Town offers the starter Pokémon known as Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip to Trainers beginning their journey of this vast land.', history: "Hoenn was created after Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre were formed. Primal Groudon raised the landmasses and Primal Kyogre filled the seas that would later become Hoenn. A meeting between these two caused a great battle for supremacy until it was quelled by Mega Rayquaza, sending Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre into caverns where they rested until they were awakened many years later during the course of events in Generation III or Generation VI. The moving of the continents by Regigigas created Hoenn, and when Regigigas was sent to sleep in the Snowpoint Temple in Sinnoh, Regirock, Registeel, and Regice, the keys to awakening it, were sealed away in Hoenn.
In contemporary history, Brendan/May moved to Littleroot Town in Hoenn from Johto. Brendan/May encountered May/Brendan, competing with Brendan/May to complete the Pokédex. Brendan/May saved Professor Birch from a PoochyenaRSORAS/ZigzagoonE with a Torchic, Mudkip, or Treecko from Professor Birch's bag; as a reward for saving him, he gave Brendan/May a Pokédex and allowed them to keep the Pokémon that they used to save him. Brendan/May traveled across Hoenn, occasionally encountering and defeating Team Aqua and Team Magma. Team MagmaREOR and/or Team AquaSEAS successfully awakened GroudonREOR and/or KyogreSEAS, which caused the region of Hoenn to be plagued by harsh sunlightROR, heavy rainSAS or a strange mixture of bothE. However, Brendan/May successfully calmed the weather Pokémon when they defeated itRSORAS or summoned Rayquaza to calm themE. Brendan/May then proceeded to win at the Pokémon League and become the Champion, and was invited to compete in the Battle FrontierE.
Upon becoming the Champion, a meteor changed course towards HoennORAS. May's/Brendan's, Wally's, and Archie'sAS/Maxie'sOR Key Stones were stolen by Zinnia in an attempt to summon Rayquaza to avert the crisis. Brendan/May encountered Zinnia at Sky Pillar and successfully summoned Rayquaza. Brendan/May gave Rayquaza the power to Mega Evolve and it destroyed the meteor.", geography: 'The Hoenn region boasts many dramatic environments from rainforests to deserts, but its most striking feature is its abundance of water, a strong contrast to other core series regions, especially Sinnoh. Much of the region is covered in water, almost equal in size to the mainland, exemplifying the theme of the games. There are several large and populated islands off the mainland only accessible via water routes, many of which are deep enough for diving.
Much of the interior area is forested or mountainous, so most notable cities are found on the coastline. People who live in towns and villages in the mountain areas must adapt to the harsh environment. An extreme example of this is the inhabitants of Fortree City, who live in tree houses. This is in stark contrast to other regions in the Pokémon world, as noted by Ruby in Pokémon Adventures, who preferred Johto\'s many modernized cities to the wilderness and countryside in Hoenn. Hoenn has one active volcano, Mt. Chimney, in the northwest of the region. The ash from Mt. Chimney regularly falls on the nearby towns and routes. On the opposite side of the Hoenn region lies the impact crater which Sootopolis City was built in.
Some of Hoenn\'s newly discovered Pokémon strongly reflect the influence of the primarily tropical environment.')
sinnoh = Generation.find_or_create_by(region: 'Sinnoh', description: "The Sinnoh region (Japanese: シンオウ地方 Sinnoh region) is a region of the Pokémon world. It is located north of Kanto, Johto, and Hoenn. It is the setting of Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Brilliant Diamond, Shining Pearl, and Legends: Arceus; the latter explores the region's earlier history and reveals its former name, Hisui. It was the fourth core series region to be introduced.
Sinnoh is composed of the large mainland, the Battle Zone on another landmass to the northeast, and several smaller islands on both sides of the region. Most of Sinnoh's routes are on land, having very few water routes, in vast contrast to Hoenn. The region is divided by Mt. Coronet, roughly comparable to how the continent that Kanto and Johto make up is essentially a contiguous region.", history: 'Sinnoh was originally known as the Hisui region.
According to several myths, this region was the first of all the regions in the Pokémon world to have been created. In a void of nothingness, a single Egg came into being, which then hatched into Arceus, the first Pokémon to be in existence. Arceus created Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina, then gave them the abilities to control time, space, and anti-matter respectively. Giratina was banished to another dimension for its violent behavior. Then, during the very early formation of the world, Arceus created Azelf, Uxie, and Mesprit to create willpower, knowledge, and emotion respectively, things that are in all modern humans and Pokémon. They dove to the bottom of present-day Lake Valor, Lake Acuity, and Lake Verity, an act which earned them the name "the lake trio". At that point, Arceus created the Hisui region and Mt. Coronet divided the region into two sections. During this violent procedure, Stark Mountain was created and Heatran was formed in lava. Arceus finally created the Adamant, Lustrous, and Griseous Orbs before falling into a never-ending sleep at the Hall of Origin.
Around this time, Mew was thought to have come into being by itself, containing the DNA of every Pokémon to exist and exist in the future. Human habitation of Hisui is estimated to have begun when Hisui was created, as said in myth. It is stated that Pokémon and humans led separate lives, but always helped each other. They supplied each other with goods, and supported each other. A Pokémon proposed to the others to always be ready to help humans, and that Pokémon be ready to appear before humans always. Thus, to this day, Pokémon appear to humans if they venture into tall grass.
Pokémon Legends: Arceus depicts the settling of the Hisui region by humans. It was eventually renamed to Sinnoh.
Palkia, Giratina, and Dialga on the Spear Pillar.
Later on came the events of Floaroma Town. According to the townspeople, Floaroma Town was once a barren and desolate hill. People started planting flowers around it to cheer up the place, but nothing would grow. Then, someone expressed thanks for a blessing of nature, and the whole hill burst into bloom. It is theorized that Shaymin was the cause of the sudden burst of flowers, given it being the Gratitude Pokémon, and its ability to "instantly transform ruined land into a lush field of flowers," according to its Pokédex entry.
In contemporary history, Lucas/Dawn and Barry leave Twinleaf Town in an attempt to see a Pokémon, like the recently reported red Gyarados, in the nearby Lake Verity. After receiving one of Professor Rowan\'s Pokémon to call their own, their journey begins in earnest, and both Lucas/Dawn and Barry challenge the Sinnoh region\'s eight Gyms to gain the Badges necessary to challenge the Pokémon League. Along the way, however, Lucas/Dawn is brought into many conflicts with Team Galactic, whose leader, Cyrus, wishes to remake the entire universe in his image with the powers of the Legendary Pokémon Dialga and Palkia. Defeating the team and calming Dialga/Palkia (or Giratina in Platinum canon), Lucas/Dawn challenges Sinnoh\'s Elite Four and Champion, Cynthia, and becomes Champion him/herself. In Pokémon Platinum, Cyrus accidentally opened a portal to the Distortion World above Mt. Coronet while trying to create a new world for himself. The portal atop Mt. Coronet was able to be closed, but a passageway to this strange dimension still remains in the depths of Sendoff Spring.
After becoming the Champion of Sinnoh, Lucas/Dawn is contacted by Barry, who they join in taking a ship to the Battle Zone, which is home to the Battle Park (or the Battle Frontier in Platinum canon). Lucas/Dawn explores this island, and also explores Stark Mountain, where they eventually meet and capture Heatran. In Platinum canon, they also aid Looker in stopping Charon, who was here in an attempt to reform Team Galactic and attempted to use Heatran\'s power to send Stark Mountain into an eruption, alongside the reluctant Mars and Jupiter who defect from the team without Cyrus. Looker then proceeds to arrest Charon and put an end to Team Galactic once and for all.', geography: "Sinnoh features a broad range of new and classic environments for the player to explore including, for the first time in a Pokémon RPG, snowy routes. Its terrain is varied: some parts of the region are dry and mountainous; others are wet and swampy. The region is rich in water.
Due to its large size, the main region of Sinnoh can be broken into two sub-regions divided by Mt. Coronet, roughly comparable to how the continent that Kanto and Johto make up is essentially a contiguous region. Due to this, Shellos and Gastrodon have developed an instance of regional speciation, with members of the species found on the eastern side being blue-colored and members on the western side being pink-colored.
The western half of Sinnoh features a variety of landscapes. Its coasts are notably more rocky than the eastern half, however, the land is far more fertile, and the towns, for the most part, are rural. A windswept canyon, carved out by a river that flows from Mt. Coronet, is home to the Valley Windworks, which provides clean, wind-driven electricity to the nearby towns. This is not to say, however, that there is no importance to west Sinnoh, as Oreburgh City, Eterna City, and Canalave City are the locations of Pokémon Gyms, and Jubilife City, at the heart of the area, is the most technologically advanced city in the region.
Sinnoh's eastern half is home to a vast many more things, including Pokémon Super Contests in Hearthome City, a Department Store in Veilstone City, the Great Marsh of Pastoria City, and the awe-inspiring Vista Lighthouse of Sunyshore City.

unova = Generation.find_or_create_by(region: 'Unova', description: "The Unova region (Japanese: イッシュ地方 Isshu region) is a region of the Pokémon world. It is the setting of Pokémon Black and White and Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. It was the fifth core series region to be introduced.
Unova is far away from the four other large regions, and the Pokémon which inhabit Unova are diverse and different from those of Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh. In his director's column, Junichi Masuda suggested that the geographical and social background for Unova draws inspiration from the New York City metropolitan area. Although it is geographically based on New York City, it draws inspiration for its landmarks from the entire state of New York, which features a mixture of rural locations and urban areas as well as factory towns and industrial complexes.", history: "In contemporary history, a present containing three starter Pokémon—one each for Cheren, Bianca, and Hilda/Hilbert—was sent to Hilda/Hilbert's house in Nuvema Town by Professor Juniper on their mothers' request, so that they could each start their Pokémon journeys through the Unova region, challenging each of Unova's eight Gyms in order to collect Badges and eventually reach the Pokémon League. During their travels, Hilda/Hilbert met and battled with the members of Team Plasma many times, including their king, N, and encountered the mysterious Shadow Triad, with events coming to a head at Dragonspiral Tower, where N managed to capture one of the members of the Tao trio and invited Hilda/Hilbert to face him after they had beaten the Pokémon League and resurrected the complementary dragon from the Light StoneB/Dark StoneW. On retrieving the appropriate stone from Nacrene Museum and defeating the Elite Four, Hilda/Hilbert reached the Champion's room, where N was waiting for them, having just defeated the Champion. N then summoned his castle, which rose out of the earth surrounding the Pokémon League; Team Plasma had been working tirelessly for years prior to build the fortress around the Pokémon League right under their nose, overworking the Pokémon gifted to them by Trainers they had emotionally manipulated into doing so for this purpose. N then invites Hilda/Hilbert into the castle to battle him in order to test the strength of their convictions.
On entering the castle, Hilda/Hilbert are ambushed by all of the Seven Sages (except Ghetsis), who planned to defeat them so that their king's reign would be unopposed. Fortunately, Bianca arrived, bringing all the Gym Leaders of the region that she was able find with her (which includes all of them except for Chili, Cress, and Cilan, whom Bianca claimed she could not contact in time). The Gym Leaders then opted to engage the Seven Sages in battle on Hilda/Hilbert's behalf, so that they were able to ascend through the castle and defeat N. Eventually, Hilda/Hilbert reached Team Plasma's King in the throne room, where N summoned his member of the Tao trio, who subsequently came crashing through the farthest wall of the room. The presence of ReshiramW/ZekromB then activated the player's dormant stone, which emerged from the Bag and transformed into its counterpart, ZekromW/ReshiramB. The latter then allowed Hilda/Hilbert to attempt to capture them and after doing so, Hilda/Hilbert proceeded to defeat N in the ensuing battle.
N's loss to his opponent caused Ghetsis to storm into the room in rage, insisting that N was a complete failure and a freak and revealing his true motivation for Team Plasma. By separating all other Pokémon from their Trainers, while Team Plasma retained their own, he, as leader of the group (acting through N), would have been left in a position of power from which he could have dominated the world. However, his delusions of grandeur were cut short by his defeat in a final Pokémon battle at the hands of Hilda/Hilbert followed by his arrest.
N, however, was not arrested and subsequently flew from the land on ReshiramW/ZekromB in order to do some soul searching in light of Ghetsis's revelations. He was not seen again in Unova, but there is a rumor that someone with a strong resemblance to N was spotted somewhere in a far-off region. Hilda/Hilbert then continued the rest of their journey, managing to also cover eastern Unova, (becoming the first person to successfully operate the Poké Transfer), locate and aid in the arrest of the remaining Seven Sages, and eventually return to the League to defeat the Pokémon League Champion Alder themselves. Afterwards, after some time reflecting, Bianca decides to become an assistant to Professor Juniper to aid in her research, and Hilda/Hilbert leaves Unova to search for N.", geography: "Unova is divided by two rivers that lead into an ocean to the south of it. These rivers cannot be surfed on, with the exception of the river directly below Village Bridge. It divides Unova into central and eastern peninsulas and a western landmass. These three landmasses are connected by five bridges: the Skyarrow Bridge, the Driftveil Drawbridge, the Tubeline Bridge, Marvelous Bridge, and the Village Bridge. The eastern part of Unova is further divided by mountains that makes a southeast part and northeast part. The southeastern part is important to Trainers who want to compete in the Pokémon league since two Gyms are located there, but the northeastern part is not since there are no Gyms there and it mostly has tourism, as evidenced by the amount of people speaking foreign languages. Further away from this bundle of towns is where the Pokémon League is located. Interestingly, the northeastern part is the only place in the region to find Pokémon species foreign to Unova outside of Swarms. The central peninsula of Unova consists of two of the largest cities in the Pokémon world, Castelia City and Nimbasa City, as well as Opelucid City further north, all of which contain Gyms. Every bridge in Unova connects to the central part of the region from either the east or west. The western side contains medium-sized towns and more varied landscapes but it also has three Gyms there, making it another destination to visit for any Pokémon Trainer.
Unova is a mixture of urban and rural land. The region features 21 settlements which reflect the diversity of the region. Many cities have buildings that resemble real-world buildings, such as Striaton City and Castelia City. However, some cities remain the way buildings in the past do, such as Humilau City, which has mostly wooden buildings on platforms above the ocean. Castelia City, a sprawling metropolis, is one of the largest cities in the Pokémon world. Nuvema Town, which is inhabited by the Pokémon expert Professor Juniper, is smaller and quieter. Black City is a version-exclusive city found only in Pokémon Black. Unova's landscape also features several forests (one of which, White Forest, is also version-exclusive), a desert, a magnetic cave and areas where the move Dive can be used outside of battle. Although Unova appears in some ways more technologically advanced than the previous regions, this development is not spread across the whole of the region. There are several aesthetic differences in the region depending on the version; in Pokémon White and White 2, these changes make the geography more rural looking, while in Pokémon Black and Black 2, these changes are more technological in appearance.")
kalos = Generation.find_or_create_by(region: 'Kalos', description: 'The Kalos region (Japanese: カロス地方 Kalos region) is a region of the Pokémon world. It was the sixth core series region to be introduced and is the setting of Pokémon X and Y.
It is shaped like a five-pointed star, with one of its biggest cities being Lumiose City in the north-central part of the region. It features a vast network of rivers and waterways snaking through much of its landscape, cities and towns. North-east of Lumiose City lies a mountain range where more frigid temperatures exist, extending down into the plains below. Western Kalos features a vast ocean, where the shoreside city of Shalour City lies in the middle of a cove.', history: "In contemporary history, Calem/Serena leaves their home in Vaniville Town, meeting Shauna and Serena/Calem, who invite them to join the pair for a meeting in Aquacorde Town. Calem, Serena, and Shauna receive their starter Pokémon from Tierno and a Pokédex from Trevor on behalf of Professor Sycamore. After delivering a letter to their Mom from Professor Sycamore, they head on an adventure traveling across Kalos challenging Gyms in order to earn eight Badges to then challenge the Pokémon League. Over the course of their journey, they come into contact with Team Flare, an organization whose goal is to create a \"beautiful and better\" world while making money. They try to do this by stealing Fossils from Glittering Cave, siphoning electricity from the Kalos Power Plant, stealing the Poké Balls from the Poké Ball Factory in Laverre City, and attempting to agitate and capture an Abomasnow. Calem/Serena also encounters a mysterious giant called AZ on several occasions, initially on Kalos Route 13. After earning their seventh Badge from Olympia, Calem/Serena is contacted by Lysandre, a man introduced by Professor Sycamore, who reveals both himself as the leader of Team Flare, and his intention to use the \"ultimate weapon\" to eliminate all life in the world except for those in Team Flare. Calem/Serena battle Lysandre, first in Lysandre Labs, and again in the Team Flare Secret HQ, before making their way down to the basement where they find XerneasX/YveltalY and battle them, before battling against Lysandre once more. Even though Lysandre is defeated, and Calem/Serena and their friends reason with him, he still fires the ultimate weapon. The blast the weapon emits destroys it and buries Lysandre and the HQ, ultimately disbanding Team Flare. Calem/Serena then heads to the Pokémon League where they defeat the Elite Four and Diantha, becoming Champion of Kalos. Professor Sycamore then holds a grand ceremony in Kalos to celebrate Calem/Serena's victory, and all of their friends' efforts in defeating Team Flare. During the ceremony, a large mysterious man challenges Calem/Serena to a battle and is defeated, but is grateful to them, for in the battle, he finally felt free from the sorrow and rage he felt in creating the ultimate weapon. As such, the man is revealed to be the ancient king AZ, and having once again become the man who loved Pokémon with all his heart, his long lost partner Floette returns to him, resulting in a tearful reunion.
After the ceremony, Calem/Serena is invited to Kiloude City to partake in its Battle Maison, and is given a train pass for it by Professor Sycamore. After partaking in a few battles there, they are informed by Professor Sycamore that the Anistar sundial can radiate special energy, and their Mega Ring is upgraded to be able to locate Mega Stones hidden across Kalos during twilight. Calem/Serena then returns to Lumiose City, where they are contacted by Looker, who has a series of cases he wants them to investigate. Calem/Serena takes part in a series of trials across Lumiose and become's Looker's second-in-command. During the investigations, Calem/Serena and Looker meet an orphan girl named Emma and her Espurr named Mimi, who are living in the alleys of Lumiose. Eventually, Looker offers to let Emma live in the Looker Bureau. However, soon after, a mysterious figure vandalizes the Lumiose Museum and also lures Trainers in to steal their Pokémon. Upon investigating these cases, and through the help of Malva, they learn that the crimes are being committed by Essentia, who is actually Emma in a suit that enhances her power, but she is unconscious in doing this: she is actually being controlled by Xerosic. Calem/Serena and Looker track Xerosic down to a secret floor in Lysandre Labs, and manage to defeat Essentia in a series of battles. Looker captures Xerosic, and takes him away, and parts ways with Calem/Serena and Emma, and despite the latter's hesitance, Looker reassures her that their bonds will always be strong no matter how far apart they are.", geography: "The geography of Kalos varies greatly within the region. The region is naturally bordered by a vast ocean to the west and northwest, and the eastern and southern borders are formed by mountain ranges. These borders give the region its signature star-like shape, as a large peninsula reaches out to the sea in the northwest, creating one point, and elsewhere the coastline, mountain ranges and rivers create the remaining four points. Kalos is made up of three distinct divisions, all with their own unique characteristics in both geography and Pokémon: Central Kalos, Coastal Kalos, and Mountain Kalos. The bustling Lumiose City is located near the point where all three divisions meet.
Central Kalos is located in the centric and southern parts of the region. The area is dominated by large forested plains with multiple rivers crossing it, with very few changes in elevation. Several towns are surrounded by walls of some sort, and there are also many old castles and châteaus. Many important human settlements and landmarks are located here, such as Vaniville Town, Santalune City, a portion of Lumiose City, and the Parfum Palace.
Coastal Kalos is located by the vast sea in the western parts of Kalos. The mainly explored area is a strip between mountains and the sea. This area is dominated by rocky shores in the southwest and lush beaches and forests in the northwest. Most human settlements are located by the sea. The peninsula in the northwest is known for its menhir stones. There are many important locations, such as the Reflection Cave, Geosenge Town, and Shalour City with its Tower of Mastery.
Mountain Kalos is located in the eastern reaches of the region. The area is largely mountainous and the temperatures tend to be cooler than in the other parts, with some routes and settlements having snow covering them. To the north there is a marshy area that is said to be haunted. However, the settlements are plentiful, and there are some important landmarks, such as the Kalos Power Plant that is built on a harsh wasteland, the Poké Ball Factory in Laverre City, and the Pokémon League.
Kiloude City is located outside the three divisions, and is only reachable by train from Lumiose City. The city is relatively isolated from the other parts of the region, being completely surrounded by mountains.")

Alola is made up of five islands: the natural islands Melemele Island, Akala Island, Ula'ula Island, and Poni Island; and the artificial island Aether Paradise. It is a popular resort destination and attracts a lot of tourists from other regions. In Alola, humans and Pokémon coexist in a very close relationship, and a culture has developed that is different from other regions.", history: "Elio/Selene leaves their home on Route 1 on a Pokémon journey three months after moving to the Alola region from Kanto. they receive their starter Pokémon from Hala and meet Lillie and Hau. Elio/Selene receives a Z-RingSM/Z-Power RingUSUMat the festival inaugurating their island challenge, consisting of seven trials and four grand trials in order to become the island challenge champion. Along their journey, they encounter a group called Team Skull, whose members are misfits who failed the island challenge and aim to cause trouble, as well as another group called the Aether Foundation, whose goal is to cure hurt Pokémon. After defeating the leader of Team Skull, Guzma, at the Shady House, they learn that Lillie was taken away by Team Skull, and upon Gladion's request, Elio/Selene travel to Aether Paradise to rescue Lillie, where they battle Lusamine, the president of the Aether Foundation who is also revealed to be Lillie and Gladion's mother. Lusamine opens Ultra Wormholes across Alola and enters one with Guzma. Elio/Selene and Lillie evolve Nebby into SolgaleoSUS/LunalaMUM at the Altar of the SunneSUS/Altar of the MooneMUM and travel into Ultra Space, where Elio/Selene battles Lusamine again and bring her and Guzma back to Alola.SM. Elio/Selene catches SolgaleoS/LunalaM after Lillie tells it that she isn't a Trainer.SM Alternatively, Lusamine and Guzma are immediately ejected from Ultra Space upon the Altar, being defeated by Necrozma, who arrives and captures Solgaleo/Lunala and absorbs it into its body, becoming Dusk Mane/Dawn Wings Necrozma, and proceeds to not only summon Ultra Beasts into Alola, but steals all of Alola's light. With help from the Ultra Recon Squad, Elio/Selene rides atop a ride Lunala/Solgaleo and goes to Ultra Megalopolis to chase down Necrozma, who then uses the light it took from Solgaleo/Lunala to become Ultra Necrozma, its original form. Elio/Selene successfully defeats Necrozma and separates Solgaleo/Lunala from it, and Alola is saved.USUM Elio/Selene climbs Mount Lanakila to its summit, the newly opened Pokémon League, where they defeat the Elite Four and Professor KukuiSM/HauUSUM, becoming the first Champion of Alola. A festival is held in Iki Town, and Lillie brings Elio/Selene to the Ruins of Conflict to battle Tapu Koko.
The next day, Lillie leaves for Kanto to help her mother. The International Police contact Elio/Selene to investigate and catch the Ultra Beasts unleashed across Alola.SM Alternatively, Gladion leaves the region by boat, returning a month later. The player then returns home, where they are contacted by Hau and the Ultra Recon Squad to catch BlacephalonUS or StakatakaUM. They then learn of Team Rainbow Rocket, who take over the Festival Plaza and Aether Paradise. Lillie reaches out to Elio/Selene for help and they intervene, dealing with several Rainbow Rocket Grunts in the altered Aether Paradise, as well as several past villainous Team Leaders in Archie, Maxie, Cyrus, Lysandre, and Ghetsis, all coming from timelines where they were successful in their plans. Finally, they reach Lusamine's chamber and defeat Rainbow Rocket's Giovanni, who then leaves the Paradise and restores it to normal after his defeat. However, before he leaves, he subtly implies he has yet more plans in mind.", geography: "The Alola region consists of four main islands: Melemele Island, Akala Island, Ula'ula Island, and Poni Island. It also includes one artificial island, Aether Paradise, described as a \"Very Large Floating Structure\" or VLFS. Players can travel between the islands via boat, the Poké Ride's Charizard Glide, and Mantine Surf; it is not possible to use the Poke Ride's Lapras Paddle or Sharpedo Jet to move between the islands. (It is also impossible to use Surf or Fly for inter-island travel, since these moves cannot be used outside of battle in Generation VII.) All four natural islands are, to an extent, forested and mountainous. Most of these islands' cities and towns are on the coast, with the notable exceptions of Iki Town and Paniola Town. Routes are relatively developed here compared to other regions, with several of them having their own Pokémon Centers in addition to residential buildings.
Though steeped in nature, Melemele Island, in the northwest of the archipelago, has the least extreme environments. It is home to Alola's largest settlement, Hau'oli City. Its routes gently slope up towards the center of the island to form a gradual mountain, on top of which are the Ruins of Conflict. A notable Melemele Island landmark is Ten Carat Hill, which was formed out of an underwater volcano and has an open-air hollow in the middle, itself resembling a volcano.
Akala Island, in the northeast of the archipelago, contains Alola's only active volcano, in Wela Volcano Park. It also has the most settlements of the four natural islands. Its largest city, Heahea City, boasts several huge resort hotels, such as the Hano Grand Resort, which has its own beach and golf course. A notable Akala Island landmark is Brooklet Hill, which has cascading waterfalls that give off the impression of a terrace field.
Ula'ula Island, in the southeast of the archipelago, is the largest of Alola's islands. It is also the most varied in terms of weather and terrain, with significantly rougher terrain areas than other islands. For such a large island, it has few settlements: Malie City, the largest city in Ula'ula; Tapu Village, destroyed by the Tapu a long time ago, contains just a Pokémon Center; and Po Town, occupied by Team Skull. These settlements all sit in the shadow of a contiguous mountain range in the heart of the island, which includes three mountain peaks and a harsh desert. On the southwest coast of the island is a large lagoon with breakable rocks that the Poké Ride's Sharpedo Jet can break through. Notable Ula'ula Island landmarks are the Lake of the MooneSUS and Lake of the SunneMUM, both perfectly circular lakes that have special connections to the Legendary Pokémon of Alola, Solgaleo and Lunala.
Poni Island, in the southwest of the archipelago, is the most sparsely populated of Alola's islands, with only one settlement. Similar to the Battle Zone in Sinnoh, it is full of rugged and harsh environments. Though its coasts are fairly flat, the island is mostly mountainous and rocky, in part due to the sprawling Vast Poni Canyon — described as a natural trial site — that takes up over half the island's land.
Aether Paradise, just west of the center of the archipelago, starkly contrasts with the natural islands. It is strikingly modern, with a huge building in the center that serves as both the main area and the headquarters of its owners, the Aether Foundation. Behind this building is a sprawling mansion that serves as the office and residence of its head, Lusamine.")

The two receive Pokédexes from Sonia, Dynamax Bands from Professor Magnolia, and endorsements from Leon to enter the Gym Challenge. They head on an adventure traveling across Galar challenging Gyms in order to earn eight Badges to enter the Champion Cup. Over the course of their journey, they encounter a group called Team Yell, whose members support Marnie in the Gym Challenge. They also encounter another group called Macro Cosmos, a conglomerate led by Rose, who has endorsed his ward Bede in the Gym Challenge. During the Champion Cup in Wyndon Stadium, Rose interrupts the Championship Match by reawakening Eternatus and bringing about the Darkest Day in an attempt to provide energy for the Galar region in 1,000 years. Victor/Gloria and Hop find a Rusted Sword and Rusted Shield and head to the Energy Plant in Hammerlocke, where they battle Rose and summon Zacian and Zamazenta. After defeating it, Victor/Gloria manages to catch Eternatus and returns to Wyndon to defeat Leon in the Championship Match, becoming the new Champion of Galar.
Afterwards, Hop and Victor/Gloria return to the Slumbering Weald to return the Rusted Sword and Rusted Shield back, but are met with a pair of odd people who call themselves Sordward and Shielbert, self-proclaimed descendants of the original king. The two try to harm Zacian and Zamazenta's reputation by releasing Dynamax particles all across Galar to experiment and sent multiple Dynamax Pokémon out of control at all the stadiums, which Piers also joins in attempting to stop them. Sonia tracks them down to the Energy Plant, where they eventually try to use Dynamax particles to send Zamazenta or Zacian into an uncontrollable fury, but they resist and instead attack Sordward or Shielbert. Victor/Gloria successfully calms them down, and then Zacian or Zamazenta steps in, and proceeds to challenge Victor/Gloria to a battle to catch them, which they succeed in doing. Afterwards, they return to the Slumbering Weald, in which Hop successfully calms and catches Zamazenta/Zacian, and challenges Victor/Gloria to one final battle.", geography: "The Galar region is an expansive region with many environments containing an idyllic countryside, contemporary cities, vast plains, and craggy snow covered mountains. The extreme south of the Galarian mainland includes the mountainous Crown Tundra in the south. North of that range lies the dense Slumbering Weald and the beginning of a long stretch of plains dotted with hills. Postwick marks the start of these plains, which end just north of Hammerlocke. Various arid, rocky environments sit at the northern edges of the plains, including the cliffs outside Stow-on-Side on Route 6 and the ruins south of Circhester on Route 8. In northwest Galar, surrounding Ballonlea, is the Glimwood Tangle, a thick, gloomy forest. East of this forest lies a broad tundra that includes the city of Circhester and a range of mountains that separates the metropolis of Wyndon from the rest of Galar.")
